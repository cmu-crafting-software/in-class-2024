## Activity
Using the jupyter notebook, you will present the following questions, and then answer the question using code:

-  What is the distribution of all GDPs in 2007.  You might find this helpful: [boxplots](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.boxplot.html)
-  after reading the file gapminder_all.csv, plot the boxplot for life expectancies for 2007, grouped by Continent.  You might find this helpful: [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html)
- **Stretch goal:**  find another question to ask and answer in the jupyter notebook.
